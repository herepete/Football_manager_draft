# Football_manager_draft
A CLI game combining the best bits of NFL and Football (soccer)

The program needs a few tweaks to make it better and i have some future ideas for changes

usability
better handling of a incorrect number chosen during draft
better menu's

future ideas
playoff and then superbowl rather than straight to superbowl
impprove match engine
allow different formations other than 4-4-2
introduce money/wages/salary cap to give extra level of complexity
allow inital team selection to be based on scenarios "an old team" / "a bad team"
make better use of max skill as at the moment it not doing much
move up and down the draft board (maybe determined on how good your previous season was)
