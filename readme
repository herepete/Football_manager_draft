Intro

So the game is a hybrid of Football (Soccer) & NFL
Football - Formation,Skills,
NFL - Draft,league strucure, superbowl

At the moment the computer will choose your best team
based on a 4-4-2 formation and the players with the highest skill
your first x1 make up the bulk of the teams matchday skill but the whole squads char and skill is also taken into account.
As each year players skills go up and down at the end of the season (generally under 21's will increase quicker and over 30 will start losing skills) you will need to constantly change the squad.
Experience and age increase by +1 at the end of each year
Skills and max skill can increase or decrease at the end of each year 

Each player has a skill rating of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 20
A perfect team would be your first 11 all having skills of 20 & each member of the squad having a charactuer of 10 and experience of 10+, 
the risk is though of the perfect team they would have to be old to get the experience and because of that they will all start aging together and then your team would quickley start losing skills when they get over the age of 30....
the best relastic team you should aim for is a blend of youth and draft older players sparingley , always aim for players with higher char and don't over worry about experience unless you start getting to the elite end of things.

Game flow
===========

1 intro to game and your squad
2 straight into season 1
3 	play x games 
4 end of season
5 	+1 to players /age/experience, if you win the superbowl exp +2 
	+X to players skill/maxskill based on things like age/characteur/luck 
	first 11 scout report (to help you pinpoint what needs to be improved)
		Draft Free agency/first/second/third round 
		choose who to replace in your squad (based on who you choose to select i.e you can only switch people in the same positions )
6) start season 2...
x) end of game after 15 seasons
	
	
Draft logic
===========

You will never get a perfect player in the draft, although you can get some very good ones.
Players  over 30's will start losing skills based on character/luck/age
Char and Experience are important for team stats on matchday and personal development (the higher the char the higher chance of a skill increase, the lower the higher chance of no change or a loss in skills based on age)
Typically you would get 1 pick in each round (although you can also get offered different packages by opposition teams to change your draft options)

free agency, older players, maxskill=20 max current skill=15,maxage=32,minage=24
first round, young players, maxskill=20 max current skill=13,maxage=23,minage=20
second round, young players maxskill=15 max current skill=10,maxage=21,minage=19
third  round, young players maxskill=15 max current skill=7,maxage=21,minage=18

Functions
=========
func_create_players.py  # create x players based on parameters, used in team creation and draft
func_endofseason.py   # +/- players attributes age,skill etc...
func_gameday.py   # logic used when you play a match
func_teamratings.py  # logic to create scout report info and feeds into gameday func 

Future tweaks
=============
Better use of max skill
at begening of game add option to choose a different team
offer draft changes
some kind of game score (team rating , results,seasons...)
